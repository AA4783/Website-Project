  <p class="text" id="conclusion"> When I first started I wasn't the best, I wasn’t great practice was the hardest thing I had ever underwent and my races didn’t go so well the first few years. However, after those early years, my teammates became my best friends and I was able to go through tougher workouts with ease. I enjoyed it more and embraced the challenge that running presented, my meet results improved as well I wasn’t competing just for the fun of it anymore or for a personal best, I found myself aiming for the podium. The greatest lesson that I have learned is that running is a journey and it takes time to see the results of your hard work, I’m grateful for every moment out on the roads and on the track. It allowed me to see who I truly was and that I truly could accomplish anything as long as I put my mind to it. So what are you waiting for? Go get out there and run, trust me you won’t regret it. </p>
