   <div> <h2 class="title">Avoiding Injuries</h2>
    <p class="text">Injuries are a part of running, however there are steps you can take to mitigate the risk of injury:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Warming up properly before a workout and stretching afterwards allows your body to start things slower and graudally build up intensity and cool down afterwards in order to help relax your muscles as well as release any tension.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have good form, good running form will help you increase your performance as well as ensure your body remains streamlined which helps reduce soreness.</li>
            <li>Know your limits, don't overburden your self, if the pain is persistent and gets worse over time stop and take some time to recover. </li>
            <li>Hydrating and eating well are important as your body needs enough fluids and a healthy balanced diet in order to function at a high level and ensure that your body is prepared for the effort.</li>

        </ul>
        </p>
    <h2 class="title">Feeling Stuck</h2>
    <p class="text">Sometimes you may feel like you hit a wall in your training or that your not improving. Sometimes it may even feel like you don't know what to do anymore, or that you no longer have any desire to run. However there are things you can do to avoid burnout:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Try Reassesing your training plan, take some time to reflect on your running.</li>
            <li>Try running with firends or some new routes to keep things fresh, consider shaking up your training plan.</li>
            <li>Taking a week off can help your body recover and get you feeling that itch to run again.</li>
            <li>It may be time to set some new goals to get you feeling that urge to run again.</li>
        </ul>
